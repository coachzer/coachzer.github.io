I am a Computer Science student from the University of Primorska, Koper, Slovenia, finishing my bachelors degree. In my thesis I am doing research in human-computer interaction (HCI) and towards touchscreen interaction. Generally I am also interested in frontend, UI/UX design, as well as drones and music in augmented reality (AR).
