I am a Computer Science student from the University of Primorska, Koper, Slovenia, finishing my bachelors degree. In my thesis I am doing research in human-computer interaction (HCI) and towards touchscreen interaction. Generally I am also interested in frontend, UI/UX design, as well as drones and music in augmented reality (AR).

Down below you can check the poster paper I have written in collaboration with Jordan Aiko Deja and Maheshya Weerasinghe, which got accepted for as a poster presentation for ACM ISS '22!
